## about

<p align="justify"> I am a PhD candidate in the department of economics at the University of Cambridge.
My primary research interests lie in microeconomic theory, information economics, and networks. 
I am interested in both pure theory and applied questions. </p>

<p align="justify"> I received an MSc in economics from the London School of Economics and an MPhil in economic research from the University of Cambridge. After graduating from LSE, I spent two years at McKinsey & Company. </p>
