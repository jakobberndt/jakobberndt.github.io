My primary research interests lie in microeconomic theory, information economics, and networks. 
I am interested in both pure theory and applied questions. </p>

<p align="justify"> I received an MSc in economics from the London School of Economics and an MPhil in economic research from the University of Cambridge. After graduating from LSE, I worked as a consultant at McKinsey & Company. </p>
