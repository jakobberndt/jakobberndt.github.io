<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify"> This paper presents a simple model of a manipulator trying to influence the collective decision of a population of agents. The novelty of this paper is to capture Bayesian persuasion followed by information diffusion in a network of agents. While some agents want the collective decision to match an unknown state of the world, others share the preferences of the manipulator. The manipulator controls the distribution of a signal observed by one agent, who communicate in a cheap talk stage. The incentives to truthfully create and transmit messages depend on the degree of manipulation and the density and distribution of biased agents. The manipulator faces a trade--off between a higher degree manipulation and better information diffusion. I find that, as biased agents share the manipulator's objective, the optimal degree of manipulation is inversely related to the density of biased agents. </p>
