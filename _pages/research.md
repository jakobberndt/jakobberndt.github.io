<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify"> This paper presents a simple model of a manipulator trying to influence the collective decision of a population of agents. The novelty of this paper is to capture Bayesian persuasion followed by information diffusion in a network of agents. While some agents want the collective decision to match an unknown state of the world, others share the preferences of the manipulator. The manipulator controls the distribution of a signal observed by one agent, who communicate in a cheap talk stage. The incentives to truthfully create and transmit messages depend on the degree of manipulation and the density and distribution of biased agents. The manipulator faces a trade--off between a higher degree manipulation and better information diffusion. I find that, as biased agents share the manipulator's objective, the optimal degree of manipulation is inversely related to the density of biased agents. </p>

<a href="" target="_blank">Higher Order Uncertainty in Social Learning </a> <br>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<p align="justify"> We frequently rely on information gleaned from observing others. When receiving signals on a rumour from an unknown source, we cannot only learn something about the veracity of the rumour, but also about the information source. 
In this paper, I study how higher order uncertainty about the information sources affects the equilibrium outcome in a model of Bayesian social learning. I look at an environment in which individuals are uncertain about the conditional distribution of signals given an underlying parameter. Agents are learning both about the unknown underlying state of nature and the signal distribution. Intuitively, if other agents received similar signals, an agent may conclude that it is more likely that his signal is informative about the state of nature. </p>
