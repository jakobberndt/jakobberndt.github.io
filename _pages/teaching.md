<p align="justify"> This course covers the standard economic models of individual decision-making with and without uncertainty, models of consumer behaviour and producer behaviour under perfect competition and the Arrow-Debreu general equilibrium model.
The course is divided into three parts: choice theory, choice under uncertainty, and general equilibrium. </p>
